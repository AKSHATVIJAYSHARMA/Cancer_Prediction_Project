# 🩺 Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project predicts whether a tumor is **malignant or benign** based on diagnostic features from a breast cancer dataset. It applies **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning classification models** to achieve accurate predictions.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- ✅ Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing**  
- ✅ Visualize key patterns through **EDA**  
- ✅ Train and evaluate **ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)**  
- ✅ Measure performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for ML models  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses the **Breast Cancer dataset** (e.g., from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))).  

**Target:**  
- `M` → Malignant  
- `B` → Benign  

**Features:**  
- `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `smoothness_mean`, etc.
